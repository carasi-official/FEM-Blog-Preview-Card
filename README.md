## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Responsive font

### What I learned

I learned a new CSS function to handle the changing of font sizes for the challenge portion of this project. I had never heard of clamp before today! https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/clamp

I also spent way too long figuring out why the rounded corners wasn’t working on my image. Realized it had nothing to do with the SVG format of the image but rather that I needed to handle the “overflow” of the image. 

### Continued development

I moved the credits section to a sticky footer at the bottom of the page this time, but I want to eventually turn that into a modal or something similar.
